The Wisej Host Service solution is based on [Owin/Katana](http://owin.org/). This extension allows you to self host any Wisej (and ASP.NET/MVC, WebForms) application as a single executable (Windows service or process) or run it as a traditional desktop application (no internet required). Includes full support for Wisej Real Time WebSocket functionality.

Standalone desktop application can use Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome (embedded) or Firefox (embedded).
