Source code for the Wisej.Ext.Translation component. Adds language translation capabilities to any Wisej application. It uses Yandex, Google, Bing, or a custom defined provider (Google and Bing are not yet implemented â€“ only Yandex is currently supported). The component accepts any text and fires an event on the server when the translation is completed.

Uses 3rd party online JavaScript library [Yandex](https://yandex.com/)
